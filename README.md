# Employee Database

This GitHub project establishes a comprehensive employee management system for companies. The Employee_Details database includes tables such as Profile_Table for job titles, Department_Table for department names, and the central Employee_Table for storing detailed employee information. The latter includes fields for personal details, contact information, and employment specifics like hire date, job title, and department, ensuring relational integrity through foreign key constraints.

Salary details are managed in the Salary_Table, with calculated total salary. Leave records are stored in the Leave_Table, tracking types, dates, and approval status. Performance evaluations, captured in the Performance_Table, include scores and comments. Employee benefits, captured in the Benefits_Table, note coverage details and benefit types.

The project also introduces an Employee_Type field in the Employee_Table for categorizing employees as Full Time, Freelancer, Trainee, or Third Party. This structured database design facilitates efficient employee information management, enhancing organizational processes.
